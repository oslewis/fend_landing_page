## Motivation

Created a simple Landing page for Tourists to get a glimpse of Japan to entice travel of the beautiful country. I have been impacted greatly by the country as I have moved there in my late teens alone and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life. I hope to get people intrigued into going and seeing the beauty of the culture and land, themselves.
